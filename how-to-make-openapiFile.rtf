Required OpenAPI Format for Tools in IBM watsonx Orchestrate
1. OpenAPI Header Section

Must include:

openapi version (3.0.0)

title

description (brief explanation of purpose)

version of the API

2. Server Section

Must include exactly one server URL with a description

This is the base API endpoint that tools will call

3. Security Section (if authentication is needed)

Define the security method such as API key or bearer token

Identify the header name for authentication (for example: api-key or Authorization)

Set global security so all operations use the same authentication unless overridden

4. Paths Section (Endpoints become tools)

Each endpoint must define:

operationId (unique, becomes tool name in Orchestrate)

summary and description (how and when to use it)

parameters (path, query, or body input fields)

valid responses using JSON schema

This structure ensures tools are recognized, configured correctly, and usable by the agent.

5. Tags Section (optional but recommended)

Used to group related tools for better UI organization
